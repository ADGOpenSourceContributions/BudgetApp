### Introduction
The word budget comes from the Old French word bougette meaning "small leather purse", which in turn is a diminutive of the Gaulish bouge for "leather pouch, purse". Its first use in our contemporary understanding of a financial plan comes from the pamphlet The Budget Opened by William Pulteney, which uses the term budget to describe and critique the governments' fiscal policy on wine and tobacco.

The common usage of the word "budget" refers to a financial plan by an individual or an organization based on their projected income and expenses. By extension, it also is used in the sense of the amount that individual or organization has available to spend.

This application is a simple budgeting application that allows the user to create a budget, add expenses, and track the amount of money they have left to spend. It helps to save money and also helps you to plan to acquire more assets.
